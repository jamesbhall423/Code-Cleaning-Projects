# Code-Cleaning-Projects

## Introduction
This repository is where I attempt to clean my code to make it more legible, easier to maintain, and more elegant. When creating projects, either for myself or for the school, I have often put making code quickly over making code the highest quality, and I don't believe this is the best practice overall. So in this block, I will look over a few sections of my code to see how it could be better written.
