# Revelation

Revelation or Connection is a game I personally designed. When I was building it, I had the idea that this was just a project for myself, so I was less focused on ensuring readability and maintainability. That does not mean that these attributes aren't useful, so I'll looking over how to increase those qualities here.

There are five main folders in the project:
| Folder      | Description      |
| ------------| -----------------|
| Main        | Contains files neccesary to compile and run the program |
| james/games/connection | Contains general purpose files |
| james/games/connection/mapmaker | Contaians files neccesary to run the mapmaker |
| james/games/connection/action | Contains classes for game action events |
| james/games/connection/maps | Contains maps generated by the mapmaker. Not a code folder. |

I see no immediate reason to change these folders, so I'll look at each of the individual folders.

| File in Main             | Description          | Notes  |
| -----------------        | ------------         | ------ |
| Connection-Compile.bat   | Compiles the project | Modified to ensure working accuracy. Possibly better as "Compile.bat" |
| Connection-Run.bat       | Runs the project     | Better Name would be "Connection.bat", except that "Connection.bat" already exists |
| Connection.bat           | Runs the project     | Defunct old file |
| Driver.java              | Java class with main method | "Main.java" would possibly be a better name. Includes functionality that would make better sense in other classes.|

Clearly one step we could to do is eliminate the old file and properly name our new execution file. However, since this is a demostration project, I'll simply rename the old file to "Connection-Old.bat"

The Driver class is more complicated. Renaming the file is simple enough, but some functions need to be moved to the IBox class.
| Function      | New Name    | Description              |
| --------      | ------------| -----------              |
|  runProgram   | launchGame  | starts a new grame frame |
|  hostProgram  | createHost  | starts a new host frame  |
|  clientProgram| createClient| starts a new client frame|
|  parseAddress | parseAddress| gets an InetAddress from a String|
After this is done we can remove unneccesary code and dependencies from the Main class. As a final note we can remove unnecesary print statements from the copied functions.
